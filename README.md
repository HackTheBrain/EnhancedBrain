## Why
Concentration plays crucial role for many jobs: flight management, technique service monitoring, writing a scientific paper.. So, developed method is able to keep the concentration on the same level and helps to do the job as productively as it is possible. Besides the concentration the method could be applied on any measurable action like happiness or passion.
## What
The method maintains human at the certain concentration level. It changes the environment using stimuli (it could be background music/disturbing sound/visual stimulation/something else) to achieve maximum concentration. It could be used when a person is working on something and suddenly concentration is falling and the system would be able to stimulate a person to return to the previous concentration level and continue to work productively.

## Ethical considerations
At first our project brings beneficence when we benefit BCI as a tool which can help people. Already according to the name of the project it is clear that there is enhancement engaged, which serves to increase concentration and then provides better efficacy in solving concentration demanding task. In this field it is important to warn all of the users of the programme that the used stimuli may not be harmless for people with epilepsy. The protection has been made by slower frequency of the stimuli. Next, our project is respectful regarded to the programme user – it depends on his or her motivation to use the programme and it respects the privacy when there are just on-line data collecting without any storage of pure EEG signal or concentration level. There are also issues of responsibility and equity on both creators and users of the programme. The creator is obliged to make the programme without any intention to harm and provide the information open to the public. On the other hand creators are not responsible for users’ misuse of the programme to different profit than it is designed for.
